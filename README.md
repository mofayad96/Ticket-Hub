 Description

This repository contains the containerized version of Ticket Hub, a full-stack web application built with React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MongoDB (database). The app is fully Dockerized using Docker Compose, ensuring reproducibility, portability, and ease of deployment.

Features

Frontend (React + Nginx) → Multi-stage Docker build for optimized production-ready static files.

Backend (Node.js/Express) → REST API handling core business logic and authentication.

MongoDB with Mongo Express → Database persistence with a simple web-based admin dashboard.

Docker & DevOps Practices:

Multi-stage builds for smaller, secure images.

Service orchestration with Docker Compose.

Internal bridge networking for inter-container communication.

Persistent volumes for MongoDB data durability.

Environment variables managed via .env for security and flexibility.
